A KISS way to deal with environment variables in Go.

## Why

At first, it was boring for me to write down an entire function just to
get some `var` from the environment and default to another in case it's missing.

For that manner, I wrote a `GetOr` function in the
[go-idioms](https://github.com/caarlos0/go-idioms) project.

Then, I got pissed about writing `os.Getenv`, `os.Setenv`, `os.Unsetenv`...
it kind of make more sense to me write it as `env.Get`, `env.Set`, `env.Unset`.
So I did.

Then I got a better idea: to use `struct` tags to do all that work for me.

## Example

A very basic example (check the `examples` folder):

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/caarlos0/env"
)

type config struct {
	Home         string        `env:"HOME"`
	Port         int           `env:"PORT" envDefault:"3000"`
	IsProduction bool          `env:"PRODUCTION"`
	Hosts        []string      `env:"HOSTS" envSeparator:":"`
	Duration     time.Duration `env:"DURATION"`
	TempFolder   string        `env:"TEMP_FOLDER" envDefault:"${HOME}/tmp" envExpand:"true"`
}

func main() {
	cfg := config{}
	err := env.Parse(&cfg)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("%+v\n", err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("%+v\n", cfg)
}
```

You can run it like this:

```sh
$ PRODUCTION=true HOSTS="host1:host2:host3" DURATION=1s go run examples/first.go
{Home:/your/home Port:3000 IsProduction:true Hosts:[host1 host2 host3] Duration:1s}
```

## Supported types and defaults

The library has built-in support for the following types:

* `string`
* `int`
* `uint`
* `int64`
* `bool`
* `float32`
* `float64`
* `time.Duration`
* `[]string`
* `[]int`
* `[]bool`
* `[]float32`
* `[]float64`
* `[]time.Duration`
* .. or use/define a [custom parser func](#custom-parser-funcs) for any other type

If you set the `envDefault` tag for something, this value will be used in the
case of absence of it in the environment. If you don't do that AND the
environment variable is also not set, the zero-value
of the type will be used: empty for `string`s, `false` for `bool`s
and `0` for `int`s.

By default, slice types will split the environment value on `,`; you can change this behavior by setting the `envSeparator` tag.

If you set the `envExpand` tag, environment variables (either in `${var}` or `$var` format)
in the string will be replaced according with the actual value of the variable.

## Custom Parser Funcs

If you have a type that is not supported out of the box by the lib, you are able
to use (or define) and pass custom parsers (and their associated `reflect.Type`) to the
`env.ParseWithFuncs()` function.

In addition to accepting a struct pointer (same as `Parse()`), this function also
accepts a `env.CustomParsers` arg that under the covers is a `map[reflect.Type]env.ParserFunc`.

To see what this looks like in practice, take a look at the [commented block in the example](https://github.com/caarlos0/env/blob/master/examples/first.go#L35-L39).

`env` also ships with some pre-built custom parser funcs for common types. You
can check them out [here](parsers/).

## Required fields

The `env` tag option `required` (e.g., `env:"tagKey,required"`) can be added
to ensure that some environment variable is set.  In the example above,
an error is returned if the `config` struct is changed to:


```go
type config struct {
    Home         string   `env:"HOME"`
    Port         int      `env:"PORT" envDefault:"3000"`
    IsProduction bool     `env:"PRODUCTION"`
    Hosts        []string `env:"HOSTS" envSeparator:":"`
    SecretKey    string   `env:"SECRET_KEY,required"`
}
```
